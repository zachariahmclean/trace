\title{Plot Repeat Correction Model}
\usage{
plot_repeat_correction_model(
  fragments_list,
  batch_run_id_subset = NULL,
  n_facet_col = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fragments_list}{A list of fragments class objects obtained from the \code{\link[=call_repeats]{call_repeats()}} function when the \code{correction = "repeat"} parameter is used.}

\item{batch_run_id_subset}{A character vector for a subset of batch_sample_id to plot. Or alternatively supply a number to select batch sample by position in alphabetical order.}

\item{n_facet_col}{A numeric value indicating the number of columns for faceting in the plot.}
}
\value{
A base R graphic object displaying the repeat correction model results.
}
\description{
Plots the results of the repeat correction model for a list of fragments.
}
\details{
This function makes plots for the model used to correct samples for each \code{batch_run_id}. The repeat correction algorithm assigns the user supplied repeat length to the modal peak of the sample, then pulls out a set of robust neighboring peaks to help get enough data to build an accurate linear model for the relationship between base-pair size and repeat length. So on this plot, each dot is an individual peak, with the colour indicating each sample, with the y-axis is the repeat length called from the user-supplied value in the metadata and the value assigned to each peak, with the x-axis showing the corresponding base-pair size.

fsa_list <- lapply(cell_line_fsa_list, function(x) x$clone())
# import data with read_fsa() to generate an equivalent list to cell_line_fsa_list
fragments_list <- trace_main(fsa_list, metadata_data.frame = metadata, correction = "repeat")

# traces of bp size shows traces at different sizes
