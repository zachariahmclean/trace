# trace package

This package provides a pipeline for short tandem repeat instability analysis from fragment analysis data. The inputs are fsa files or peak tables (eg Genemapper 5 software output), and a user supplied metadata data-frame. The functions identify ladders, calls peaks, and calculate repeat instability metrics (ie expansion index or average repeat gain).

This code is not intended to function as a genotyping tool in its current form. While the repeat lengths generated are precise, they are not accurate. The conversion from bp size to repeat length underestimates the actual repeat length because amplicons containing repeats do not run linearly with the internal size standard ladder. However, for calculating instability metrics, this inaccuracy is inconsequential since these metrics are relative measures.

# How to use the package

For an easy way to get started with your own data or to run an example, use `trace::generate_trace_template()` to generate a document with the pipeline pre-populated.

In this package, each sample is represented by an R6 'fragments' object, which are organised in lists. As a user, there are functions that iterate over these lists, so you shouldn't need to interact with the objects. However, if you do, the attributes of the objects can be accessed with "\$".

There are several important factors to a successful repeat instability experiment and things to consider when using this package:

-   (required) Each sample has a unique id, usually the file name

-   (optional) Baseline control for your experiment. For example, specifying a sample where the modal allele is the inherited repeat length (eg a mouse tail sample) or a sample at the start of a time-course experiment. This is indicated with a `TRUE` in the `metrics_baseline_control` column of the metadata. Samples are then grouped together with the `metrics_group_id` column of the metadata.

-   (optional) Using common sample(s) across fragment analysis runs to correct systematic batch effects that occur with repeat-containing amplicons in capillary electrophoresis. There are slight fluctuations of size across runs for amplicons containing repeats that result in systematic differences, so if samples are to be analyzed for different runs, the absolute bp size is not comparable unless this batch effect is corrected. This is only relevant when the absolute size of a amplicons are compared for grouping metrics as described above (otherwise instability metrics are all relative and it doesn't matter that there's systematic batch effects across runs). This correction can be achieved by running a couple of samples in every fragment analysis run, or having a single run that takes a couple of samples from every run together, thereby linking them. These samples are then indicated in the metadata with `batch_run_id` (to group samples by fragment analysis run) and `batch_sample_id` (to enable linking samples across batches).

-   If starting from fsa files, the GeneScan™ 1200 LIZ™ dye Size Standard ladder assignment may not work very well. The ladder identification algorithm is optimized for GeneScan™ 500 LIZ™ or GeneScan™ 600 LIZ™ or other ladders with relatively few peaks. The 1200 LIZ™ ladder has a challenging pattern of ladder peaks to automatically assign. However, these ladders can be fixed by playing with the various parameters or manually with the built-in fix_ladders_interactive() app.

# Installation

You can install from [GitHub](https://github.com/zachariahmclean/trace) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zachariahmclean/trace")
```

Then load the package:

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(trace)
```

# Import data

First, we read in the raw data. In this case we will used example data within this package, but usually this would be fsa files that are read in using `read_fsa()`.

```{r fsa_import}
fsa_raw <- cell_line_fsa_list
```

# Find ladders

First we find the ladders and call bp size in the fsa file. The bp is assigned using the local Southern method. Basically, for each data point, linear models are made for the lower and upper 3 size standard and the predicted sizes are averaged.

```{r ladders,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ladder_list <- find_ladders(cell_line_fsa_list,
  show_progress_bar = FALSE
)
```

visually inspect each ladder to make sure that the ladders were correctly assigned

```{r plot_ladders}
plot_ladders(ladder_list[1])
```

If the ladders are are not assigned correctly, you can adjust parameters or manually using the built-in fix_ladders_interactive() app.

# Find fragments

The fragment peaks are identified in the raw continuous trace data.

```{r find_fragments, warning=FALSE}
peak_list <- find_fragments(ladder_list,
  min_bp_size = 300
)
```

Visually inspect the traces and called peaks to make sure they were correctly assigned.

```{r plot_traces}
plot_traces(peak_list[1],
  xlim = c(400, 550),
  ylim = c(0, 1200)
)
```

Alternatively, if not starting from fsa files, this is where you would use exported data from Genemapper if you would rather use the Genemapper bp sizing and peak identification algorithms.

```{r peak_table_to_fragments,warning=FALSE}
peak_list_genemapper <- peak_table_to_fragments(example_data,
  data_format = "genemapper5",
  dye_channel = "B",
  min_size_bp = 300
)
```

# Add metadata

Metadata can be incorporated to allow additional functionality in `call_repeats()` (correcting batch effects across fragment analysis runs) and `assign_index_peaks()` (assigning index peak from another sample). Prepare a file (eg spreadsheet saved as .csv) with the following columns. If you use the specified column names, it will be automatically parsed by `add_metadata()`, otherwise you will need to match up which column name belongs to which metadata category (as done below in `add_metadata()`):

| Metadata table column    | Functionality metadata is associated with                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|
| unique_id                | Required for adding metadata using `add_metdata()`          | The unique identifier for the fsa file. Usually the sample file name. This must be unique, including across runs.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| metrics_group_id         | `assign_index_peaks()`, allows setting `grouped`            | This groups the samples for instability metric calculations. Provide a group id value for each sample. For example, in a mouse experiment and using the expansion index, you need to group the samples since they have the same metrics baseline control (eg inherited repeat length), so provide the mouse id. |
| metrics_baseline_control | `assign_index_peaks()`, allows setting `grouped`            | This is related to metrics_group_id. Indicate with ‘TRUE’ to specify which sample is the baseline control (eg mouse tail for inherited repeat length, or day-zero sample in cell line experiments)                                                                                                              |
| batch_run_id             | `call_repeats()`, allows setting `repeat_length_correction` | This groups the samples by batch. Provide a value for each fragment analysis run (eg date).                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| batch_sample_id          | `call_repeats()`, allows setting `repeat_length_correction` | This groups the samples across batches. Give a unique sample id to each different sample.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

```{r add_metadata}

metadata_added_list <- add_metadata(
  fragments_list = peak_list,
  metadata_data.frame = metadata,
  unique_id = "unique_id",
  metrics_group_id = "metrics_group_id",
  metrics_baseline_control = "metrics_baseline_control",
  batch_run_id = "batch_run_id",
  batch_sample_id = "batch_sample_id"
)
```

# Identify modal peaks and call repeats

Next we identify the modal peaks with `find_alleles()` and convert the base pair fragments to repeats with `call_repeats(`).

```{r find_alleles_and_repeats, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
alleles_list <- find_alleles(
  fragments_list = metadata_added_list
)


repeats_list <- call_repeats(
  fragments_list = alleles_list
)
```

We can view the distribution of repeat sizes and the identified modal peak with a plotting function.

```{r plot_fragments, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot_traces(repeats_list[1], xlim = c(110, 150))
```

# Assign index peaks

A key part of several instability metrics is the index peak. This is the repeat length used as the reference for relative instability metrics calculations, like expansion index or average repeat gain. In the metadata, samples are grouped by a `metrics_group_id` and a subset of the samples are set as `metrics_baseline_control`, meaning they are the samples taken at day 0 in this experiment. This allows us to set `grouped = TRUE` and set the index peak for the expansion index and other metrics. For mice, if just a few samples have the inherited repeat height shorter than the expanded population, you could not worry about this and instead use the `index_override_dataframe` in `calculate_instability_metrics()`.

```{r assign_index, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

index_list <- assign_index_peaks(
  repeats_list,
  grouped = TRUE
)

```

We can validate that the index peaks were assigned correctly with a dotted vertical line added to the trace. This is perhaps more useful in the context of mice where you can visually see when the inherited repeat length should be in the bimodal distribution.

```{r}
plot_traces(index_list[1], xlim = c(110, 150))
```

# Calculate instability metrics

All of the information we need to calculate the repeat instability metrics has now been identified. We can finally use `calculate_instability_metrics` to generate a dataframe of per-sample metrics.

```{r calculate_instability_metrics, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
metrics_grouped_df <- calculate_instability_metrics(
  fragments_list = index_list,
  peak_threshold = 0.05
)
```

These metrics can then be used to quantify repeat instability. For example, this reproduces Figure 7e of [our manuscript](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47485-0).

First, prepare the data for plotting by removing poor quality samples and finding the average repeat gain relative to the DMSO group for each cell line

```{r plot_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)


plot_data <- metrics_grouped_df |>
  dplyr::left_join(metadata, by = dplyr::join_by(unique_id)) |>
  dplyr::filter(
    day > 0,
    modal_peak_height > 500
  ) |>
  dplyr::group_by(metrics_group_id) |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    rel_gain = average_repeat_gain / median(average_repeat_gain[which(treatment == 0)]),
    genotype = forcats::fct_rev(genotype)
  )
```

Then we can plot the instability metrics

```{r ggplot}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(
  plot_data,
  aes(genotype, rel_gain, colour = genotype)
) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter() +
  facet_wrap(vars(as.factor(treatment)), nrow = 1) +
  labs(
    y = "Average repeat gain\n(relative to DMSO)",
    x = "PMS1 pseudoexon status"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
